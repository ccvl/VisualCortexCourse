To run these demos, [IPython/Jupyter notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) is required. The IPython Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document. In this document, we provide instructions of getting started with this tool."
