The README included with the downloaded code contains a brief guide about how to do that. The mex (C code) part was written and tested in a unix-like system. In the experiment, we found the code can be run normally in Mac and Linux,  but it's not stable in Windows. You are allowed to complete this part in a teamwork.\n",

    "    In this subpart, we calculate the sparse coefficient of natural images, which are included in the downloaded code in the `IMAGES` array. Run the code with different values of M with other parameters set to their default values and show what the resulting bases (shown in Fig 1) look like. Please select M from these numbers: 25, 64, 100.\n",

    "    In the 2nd subpart, we change the matrix X reconstructed by the basis from natural images to the high-frequency sinusoid images, which is different from the 1st subpart. First, the \"gensin.m\" included with this homework can help you generate the sinusoid patches. In \"gensin.m\", you need to set the \"omega\" parameter to choose certain frequency of sinusoid patches. Second, in each iteration reassign X with randomly selected patches from the high-frequency sinusoids pool generated by the \"gensin.m\" script. A few modifications are required to reassign X compared with the original code. Then change the M with other parameters set as the default. Try setting M to 4, 36, and 100 and show the resulting bases. How do these basess change with M?\n",

    "    Congrats on making it to the end! In this subpart, we need to generate low-frequency sinusoid images, which is the only difference from the 2nd subpart. Same with before, change the M with other parameters set as the default. We suggest you set the M to 4, 36, 100, and show the resulting bases. How do these bases change according to the different M? Please make comparisons with the 2nd part and explain why these differences arise. You are encouraged to use the \"ShowPatches.m\" code to visualize the sinusoid patches you generated in subparts 2 and 3. \n",
